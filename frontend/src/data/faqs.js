        body: `
<p>Unfortunately, the British electoral system results in the majority of voters having no direct representation in Parliament. This is because, under the "First Past the Post" system, votes which are <i>not</i> cast for the winning candidate are essentially entirely ignored.</p>
<p>This means that votes for parties other than the closest competitor for the Conservatives do nothing to help reduce the chance of a Conservative victory. This is why we advocate voting for the Conservatives closest competitor regardless of your other party loyalties. This is colloquially known as "Tactical Voting". If you do live a constituency where there is very little risk of the Conservatives winning (a margin of 20% or more) then you can safely vote freely.</p>
<p>For a clear and concise explanation on the subject, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9rGX91rq5I" target="_blank">check out this 5 minute video</a>, and for a comprehensive breakdown of the UK electoral system's failings there is <a href="https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/latest-news-and-research/publications/the-2017-general-election-report/" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p>
