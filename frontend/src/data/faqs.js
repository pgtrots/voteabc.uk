        body: `
<p>Unfortunately, the British electoral system results in the majority of voters having no direct representation in Parliament. This is because, under the "First Past the Post" system, votes which are <i>not</i> cast for the winning candidate are essentially entirely ignored.</p>
<p>This means that votes for parties other than the closest competitor for the Conservatives do nothing to help reduce the chance of a Conservative victory. This is why we advocate voting for the Conservatives closest competitor regardless of your other party loyalties. This is colloquially known as "Tactical Voting". If you do live a constituency where there is very little risk of the Conservatives winning (a margin of 20% or more) then you can safely vote freely.</p>
<p>For a clear and concise explanation on the subject, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9rGX91rq5I" target="_blank">check out this 5 minute video</a>, and for a comprehensive breakdown of the UK electoral system's failings there is <a href="https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/latest-news-and-research/publications/the-2017-general-election-report/" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p>

<p>It depends whether leaving the EU is your main motivation or not, and why it is important to you. And what
you think leaving the EU will look like.</p>
<p>However it happens, leaving the EU will mean years and years of negotiating trade deals.</p>
<p>If you are still set on the UK leaving the EU and this is the most important issue to you, then please consider
voting for <a href="https://www.thebrexitparty.org/">the Brexit Party</a>. At the time of putting together this website, they have not published a manifesto,
so it is unclear what their policies will be beyond <a href="https://fullfact.org/online/what-does-wto-rules-brexit-look/">a ‘WTO rules’ Brexit.</a></p>

<p>If this is your point of view then you absolutely should <b>not</b> vote for the Conservatives. The only thing that
allowing a Conservative majority to pass Boris Johnson&#39;s deal guarantees is literally decades more uncertainty
and strife as the UK seeks to renegotiate all the trade agreements it will have lost.</p>
<p>Leaving the EU is not the end of Brexit, it is only the end of the beginning.</p>
